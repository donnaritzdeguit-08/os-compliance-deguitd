LAYER 1: CLASSIC PROBLEM ANALYSIS (Brief Summary Report)

This layer covers fundamental operating system topics and concepts. It is divided into four parts, each with a corresponding main topic.

Part A discusses Process Management Fundamentals, which involves the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes, illustrated by a process state diagram. It also differentiates between processes and threads and explains how processes communicate with each other through methods known as Inter-Process Communication (IPC).

Part B focuses on Memory Management Basics. It discusses the differences between paging and segmentation, which are memory allocation techniques. Paging divides memory into fixed-size blocks, while segmentation divides it into logical, variable-size segments. The calculation of Effective Memory Access Time (EMAT) is also covered in this part.

Part C covers CPU Scheduling Principles, which are designed to balance processes in terms of fairness, efficiency, and response time. This section compares First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling with Round Robin scheduling. It also includes creating Gantt charts for these two scheduling types.

Part D provides knowledge of Classic Synchronization Problems, including the dining philosophers problem, the producer-consumer problem, and the reader-writer problem. These are classic examples used to illustrate the challenges of coordinating multiple processes or threads to ensure data consistency and prevent issues like deadlock and starvation.
